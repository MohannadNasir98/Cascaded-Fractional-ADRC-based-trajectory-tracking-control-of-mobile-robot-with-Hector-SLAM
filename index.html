    <h1>Cascaded Fractional ADRC-Based Trajectory Tracking Control of Mobile Robot with Hector SLAM</h1>
    <p>First Version - Project Webpage</p>

    <h2>Abstract</h2>
    <p>
      This research presents the design, implementation, and simulation of a robust trajectory tracking control system for a mobile robot by integrating Hector SLAM with a fractional Cascaded Active Disturbance Rejection Control (CADRC) strategy. The system is designed to operate solely with a 2D LiDAR sensor for real-time environmental perception and navigation, avoiding the need for wheel encoders or inertial sensors.
    </p>
    <p>
      This proposed approach is motivated by the limitations of conventional control methods such as PID and conventional ADRC, which often struggle in dealing with real world challenges such as measurement noise, unmodeled dynamics, and external disturbances in real-world environments. By using Hector SLAM, the system can achieve accurate localization from laser scans alone, while CADRC can improve control robustness by compensating for external disturbances, and dealing with real world challenges through a fractional-order and multi-layered observer structure.
    </p>
    <p>
      The CADRC control architecture combines a fractional-order Extended State Observer (ESO) with a cascaded loop to enhance disturbance estimation and rejection. The system is evaluated through simulation across various trajectories—including circular, infinity, and scenarios with sudden disturbances—and benchmarked against a classical PID controller to highlight performance gains in tracking accuracy and responsiveness.
    </p>
    <p>
      The results demonstrate that the proposed Hector SLAM and CADRC integration enables reliable and precise trajectory tracking under noisy and dynamic conditions. This contributes to the development of more robust, sensor-efficient autonomous robots, offering a practical solution for environments where odometry is unreliable or unavailable, with broader implications for advancing intelligent and adaptable robotic systems.

    <h2>1. Motivation & Problem Statement</h2>
    <p>The project addresses the challenge of robust trajectory tracking in mobile robots operating in environments where conventional odometry and inertial sensors are unreliable or unavailable. Traditional control strategies such as PID and ADRC face limitations in handling disturbances, noise, and model uncertainties. This project proposes a novel solution by integrating:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Hector SLAM for LiDAR-based localization without odometry</li>
      <li>Fractional Cascaded ADRC (CADRC) for robust control and disturbance rejection</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section id="system-architecture">
    <h2>2. System Architecture</h2>
    <p>The overall architecture consists of:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>LiDAR Perception:</strong> 2D RPLiDAR for environment mapping</li>
      <li><strong>Hector SLAM:</strong> Provides real-time pose estimation from laser scans</li>
      <li><strong>Controller:</strong> Cascaded Fractional ADRC with dual Extended State Observers</li>
      <li><strong>Mobile Base:</strong> Differential Drive Robot simulated in Gazebo</li>
    </ul>
    <p>A block diagram and node graph visualization will be added soon.</p>
  </section>

  <section id="simulation-scenarios">
    <h2>4. Simulation Scenarios</h2>
    <p>Multiple control cases were designed and executed to validate system performance:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Circular trajectory tracking under normal conditions</li>
      <li>Infinity trajectory with moderate noise in feedback</li>
      <li>Sudden external disturbances and recovery test</li>
      <li>Comparison to classical PID tracking under same conditions</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Each scenario demonstrates robustness, tracking accuracy, and response sharpness of the CADRC method.</p>
  </section>

  <section id="results">
    <h2>6. Results (Coming Soon)</h2>
    <p>Simulation plots and videos for the above test cases will be included in the next version:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Trajectory tracking plots (x, y)</li>
      <li>Control signals (v, w) and estimated disturbances</li>
      <li>Comparison graphs (CADRC vs PID)</li>
      <li>Demo videos embedded or linked</li>
