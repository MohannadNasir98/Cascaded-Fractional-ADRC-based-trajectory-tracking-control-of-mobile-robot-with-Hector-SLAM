    <h2>Abstract</h2>
    <p>
      This research presents the design, implementation, and simulation of a robust trajectory tracking control system for a mobile robot by integrating Hector SLAM with a fractional Cascaded Active Disturbance Rejection Control (CADRC) strategy. The system is designed to operate solely with a 2D LiDAR sensor for real-time environmental perception and navigation, avoiding the need for wheel encoders or inertial sensors.
    </p>
    <p>
      This proposed approach is motivated by the limitations of conventional control methods such as PID and conventional ADRC, which often struggle in dealing with real world challenges such as measurement noise, unmodeled dynamics, and external disturbances in real-world environments. By using Hector SLAM, the system can achieve accurate localization from laser scans alone, while CADRC can improve control robustness by compensating for external disturbances, and dealing with real world challenges through a fractional-order and multi-layered observer structure.
    </p>
    <p>
      The CADRC control architecture combines a fractional-order Extended State Observer (ESO) with a cascaded loop to enhance disturbance estimation and rejection. The system is evaluated through simulation across various trajectories—including circular, infinity, and scenarios with sudden disturbances—and benchmarked against a classical PID controller to highlight performance gains in tracking accuracy and responsiveness.
    </p>
    <p>
      The results demonstrate that the proposed Hector SLAM and CADRC integration enables reliable and precise trajectory tracking under noisy and dynamic conditions. This contributes to the development of more robust, sensor-efficient autonomous robots, offering a practical solution for environments where odometry is unreliable or unavailable, with broader implications for advancing intelligent and adaptable robotic systems.
